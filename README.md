# Final
This is a GUI to plot a simple function, f(x) = x^a, where a is any integer of a user's choice. To use the function,
the user must put 'gui()' into the command window and press enter. The GUI that pops up can be editted by the user
through the use of two buttons, one to subtract 1 from the value a and another to add 1 to the value a. Once the 
value is changed, the plot updates and the displays a graph of the function f(x) with the new a value.
